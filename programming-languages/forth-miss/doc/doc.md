CS 3520â€”Forth Missionaries and Cannibals
========================================

Write a solver for the missionaries and cannibals problem in Forth.
For review, here is the problem:

> Suppose there are three missionaries and three cannibals who need to
> cross to the far side of a river using a single boat that can carry
> one or two people at a time. Both groups will cooperate and can
> paddle back and forth freely, but old habits will lead the cannibals
> to eat the missionaries if the missionaries are ever outnumbered on
> either side of the river.
>
> The problem is to find a way to get all of the missionaries and all
> of the cannibals safely across the river.

You must write it exactly as specified below.


General tips
------------

Carefully test each word you write before moving on. The design
suggested here makes it straightforward to test most words in
isolation, but some require a bit more work to test.

If a word does not work, carefully track its use of the stack. Break
each and every word onto its own line, and document the state of the
stack after that line. For example, you could rewrite this word:

``` forth
\ check if a number is a member of the used set
: isused ( n -- bool )
    \ loop through all set elements
    usedcounter @ 0 ?do
        \ compare n with elt i
        dup used i cells + @
        \ return true if its a match
        = if drop -1 unloop exit then
    loop
    \ return false
    drop 0
;
```

to be like this:

``` forth
\ check if a number is a member of the used set
: isused ( n -- bool )
    \loop through all set elements
    usedcounter                         ( n &usedcounter )
    @                                   ( n usedcounter )
    0                                   ( n usedcounter 0 )
    ?do                                 ( n )
        \ compare n with elt i
        dup                             ( n n )
        used                            ( n n &used )
        i                               ( n n &used i )
        cells                           ( n n &used i*8 )
        +                               ( n n &used[i] )
        @                               ( n n used[i] )
        \ return true if its a match
        =                               ( n n==used[i] )
        if                              ( n )
            drop                        ( )
            -1                          ( true )
            unloop                      ( true )
            exit                        ( true )
        then                            ( n )
    loop                                ( n )
    \ return false
    drop                                ( )
    0                                   ( false )
;
```

If you are meticulous about documenting how the stack is used, it is
much easier to catch low-level mistakes. It can make it harder to
read and follow the higher-level flow of the word, however, so use
this technique judiciously. For example, you might write a word this
way, test it, and then convert it into the first version (shown
above) once you are confident that it is correct.


Overview
--------

I suggest representing states in two ways:

*   Store three values on the stack for a single state: *near*, *m*, and
    *c*. *near* is true if the boat is on the near side of the
    river. *m* and *c* are the number of missionaries and cannibals
    on the near side of the river, respectively.

*   Store all three values in a single integer. This is the "packed"
    format. While less convenient to work with, this format makes it
    easier to store states in stacks and sets.

The overall flow of the program will follow this pseudo-code:

*   push the start state on the candidate stack
*   findsolution:
    *   print the candidate stack
    *   pop a candidate state off the candidate stack
    *   push a copy on the bread-crumb trail stack
    *   if it is the goal state
        *   print out the contents of the bread-crumb trail
            in order. this is the solution to the puzzle.
    *   else
        *   generate a list of successor states (there should be
            exactly 5)
        *   push the valid, legal, fresh successors on the
            candidate stack
        *   for each successor generated in this step:
            *   call findsolution recursively
    *   pop the state off the bread-crumb trail stack

I suggest writing lots of helper words. Avoid complexity in the
findsolution word, since it will already be the most difficult part to
test. What follows is one suggested implementation. You are free to
write it a different way if you would prefer.


Implementation
--------------

Start by writing some helper words. The first few are described
adequately by their names and stack-effect comments:

``` forth
: 3dup ( x y z -- x y z x y z ) ... ;
: 3drop ( x y z -- ) ... ;
: pack ( near m c -- packedstate ) ... ;
: unpack ( packedstate -- near m c ) ... ;
: printstate ( side m c -- ) ... ;
```

Write each of these and test them thoroughly. To load code from a
source file, give the name of the source file when loading gforth:

    gforth missionaries.fs

Next, implement basic stack and set data structures:

``` forth
\ test if n is in the used set
: isused ( n -- bool ) ... ;

\ add n to the used set
: addused ( n -- ) ... ;


\ push a value on the candidate stack
: pushcandidate ( n -- ) ... ;

\ pop a value off the candidate stack
: popcandidate ( -- n ) ... ;


\ push a value on the bread crumb trail stack
: pushcrumb ( n -- ) ... ;

\ pop a value off the bread crumb trail stack
: popcrumb ( -- n ) ... ;
```

For debugging, I suggest writing words to print out the entire
contents of each of these data structures:

``` forth
\ print the contents of the used set in order
: printused ( -- ) ... ;

\ print the contents of the candidate stack in order
: printcandidates ( -- ) ... ;

\ print the contents of the bread crumb trail in order
: printcrumbs ( -- ) ... ;
```

Next, start the words to work with states:

``` forth
\ push the starting state onto the stack
: startstate ( -- near m c ) ... ;

\ test if the state on the stack is the goal state
: isgoal ( near m c -- bool ) ... ;

\ test if the state on the stack is valid and legal
: isvalid ( near m c -- bool ) ... ;
```

The next two generate, record, and report on potential next moves
from a given state:

``` forth
\ add a state to the candidate stack if it is valid and new
\ report on the outcome: invalid, repeat, or fresh
: addcandidate ( near m c -- ) ... ;

\ find all successor candidates for the given state, push them on stack
\ leaves the number of states added on the stack
: successors ( near m c -- n )
```

`addcandidate` requires a bit more explanation. It should:

*   check if the (packed) state is valid (reject it and print a
    message if not)
*   check if the (packed) state is already used (reject it and print
    a message if not)
*   otherwise:
    *   print a message indicating that it is a fresh state
    *   add the packed state to the used list
    *   add the packed state to the candidate stack

`addcandidate` is a helper for `successors`, which generates all (5)
possible successors for a given state, handing each one to
`addcandidate`, which filters some of them out and adds the rest to
the candidate stack.

Then comes the main search loop:

``` forth
\ find the solution from position at top of stack
: findsolution ( -- )
```

`findsolution` assumes that a state is already on the candidate stack, and
it uses the words already described to implement the pseudo-code
given earlier. For a word to call itself recursively, it uses the
special word `recurse` instead of the normal word name
(`findsolution` in this case).

Finally, write a `main` word that resets the stacks and the used
set, puts the start state on the candidate stack, adds it to the
used set, and calls `findsolution`.
